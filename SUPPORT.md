If you have problems with the software, there are several things you can do.

1. First of all, is it a problem with the crawling and spidering of web sites? Then it's most likely an issue that regards to [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/), the crawling software that Mechanical News is built upon. Check the [Scrapy documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/).

2. If you're sure the problem has nothing to do with Scrapy, check the [Mechanical News documentation](https://github.com/peterdalle/mechanicalnews/wiki) on the wiki and its tutorials and how-to's.

2. See if there's any [open issues](https://github.com/peterdalle/mechanicalnews/issues) in Mechanical News and if your problem has been described before, and whether or not it's been acknowledged by the developers.

3. If you're requesting a new feature, or experiencing an unexpected behavior in Mechanical News, [file a new issue](https://github.com/peterdalle/mechanicalnews/issues/new). It's important to make these issues public in order for others to offer feedback, and also for others to easily discover solutions.

4. Last but not least, if you've exhausted all alternatives, or have another inquiry, please contact lead developer [Peter M. Dahlgren](https://peterdahlgren.com/contact/).
