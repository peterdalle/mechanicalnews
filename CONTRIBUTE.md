# How to contribute to Mechanical News

## You can help with

- Add a custom web scraper.
- Test the software and report bugs.
- Improve documentation.

## Beginners guide

Read, for example, [The beginner's guide to contributing to a GitHub project](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/#summary). 

Summary:

1. Fork the project and clone locally.
2. Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch.
3. Branch for each separate piece of work.
4. Do the work, write good commit messages, and make sure you follow the guidelines above.
5. Push to your origin repository.
6. Create a new pull request in GitHub.
7. Respond to any code review feedback.

## Guidelines

- follow [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to make the code consistent.
- follow [PEP 287 -- reStructuredText Docstring Format](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/) to comment the code.

These are *guidelines*, not rules to die for.

But do make sure to **unit test as much as possible**.
